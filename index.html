    <p>For MAE 52, a SolidWorks class, I created the Delorean from Back to the Future as my final project. This required many advanced SolidWorks techniques to capture the unique features of the car.</p>

            <p>Overall I am very proud of my project and have greatly improved my SolidWorks Skills throughout this process. Before this, I had never touched surfacing, but now I can confidently use surfaces to create organic shapes that are otherwise impossible with solids. The most difficult part of the project was learning how to properly 3D sketch in order to form sleek shapes that I needed. If I were to do this again, I would model the interior and redesign the front of the car.</p>
